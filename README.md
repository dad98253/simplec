An Internet Protocol server application for viewing ANSI (color) text data sent via UDP or TCP. Its primary purpose is to display remote text information generated by the remote debug library used in the passwin/passlin application.


The follow-on goal of this project is to port the code to OS-X and FreeBSD.
